# Doodle Pens

An exploration of pen tools in an online canvas. With the blend pen, users can create textual shapes that blend with each other and the canvas. With the DNA pen, users type in their name, which is "encoded" into DNA that they draw with. Also, the pens can work on mobile where users can draw with their finger _(Note: UI is off, not the same scale as on desktop)_
